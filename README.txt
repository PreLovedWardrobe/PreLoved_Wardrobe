Website prototype created for your C2C brand.
Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- assets/logo.png (placeholder) -> replace with your real logo
- assets/sample1.jpg, sample2.jpg, sample3.jpg -> replace with product photos

To preview locally:
1. Download and unzip website_prototype.zip
2. Open index.html in a browser (double-click). For full functionality consider serving via a local static server (e.g. 'python -m http.server' inside the folder).

Customizations you should make:
- Replace assets/logo.png with the brand logo from your PPT (keep filename or update src in index.html)
- Replace sample images with real product photos
- Update brand name, tagline, contact email in index.html
- Connect forms to a real backend or services like Firebase, Supabase, or formsubmit.co for demos.
- If you want I can convert this into a React/Vue template or create WordPress/Shopify theme files.

I've bundled everything into website_prototype.zip
